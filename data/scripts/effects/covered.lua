--Right now this will probably be really buggy, since Covered is not necessarily the first effect that will activate on the target

--Really need to do more research on this, figure out how it interacts with multi-hit attacks, aoe attacks (if those count as melee ever?), etc.
--If it redirects the whole attack instead of a single hit, we might need a new that activates while iterating over targets.
