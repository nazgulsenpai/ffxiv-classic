--The amount of time it takes to fully charge varies depending on how much MP it has to restore, meaning its not just a percent every tick
--Based on a few videos it seems like it heals for 0.5% of max MP every second, traited. This is an early guess but it seems correct
--Untraited is less clear. It could be 0.25%, 0.30%, or 0.40%. Guessing it's 0.30
