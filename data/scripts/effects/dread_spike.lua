--Dread spike completely nullifies a physical action and absorbs how much damage it would have done (when it's powered up)
--I'm going to assume it only absorbs half damage without LS/PS up
--When I say it nullifies an attack, it even gets rid of the message. It's as if the damage action didn't happen. 
--It still shows the enemy's "Enemy used [command]." message but there is no 0 damage dealt message.
--Don't know how this works with multi-hit attacks or even how it works with stoneskin or other buffs that respond to damage
-- I dont really know how this should work...
